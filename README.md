# LisPy_Interpreter
An interpreter in Python for Lisp
So far the interpreter can evaluate arithmetic expressions, including nested expressions.

This interpreter works in Python 3.4, and it contains regular expression package (regular expression is built-in). If regular expression package cannot be imported, try `pip install regex`

To run this interpreter, first download Python (preferably version 3.4) and download the interpreter files on github.
Then execute this in your terminal `python lispy_interpreter.py`
Input "Quit" or control-C to terminate the interpreter.

To run the test cases, execute `python test_cases.py`, if nothing shows up in the terminal, then all test cases are passed.
